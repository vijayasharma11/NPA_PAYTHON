1.Start Program
2.Initialize the Balance to 2500.
3 .Define an array payments[] that stores the monthly payments:
    payments = [160, 160, 150, 150, 150, 150, 160, 155, 150, 160, 150, 150]
4.print the user to enter a month as an integer (1 for January, 12 for December).
5.Validate the month input to ensure it's between 1 and 12.
6.If the month is valid, 
    calculate the total payments made up to and including that month:
7.Add all the payments from index 0 to the index corresponding to the entered month.
8.Subtract the total payments from the Balance to calculate the Settlement Figure.
9.Display the Settlement Figure.
10.If the month input is invalid, display an error message and prompt again.
